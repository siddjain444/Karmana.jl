Read nighttime lights data from a specific directory and return two raster series representing radiance and coverage.

# Arguments
- `xlims`: An instance of `X(Rasters.Between(min, max))`, defining the X-coordinate limits. Default is `X(Rasters.Between(65.39, 99.94))`.
- `ylims`: An instance of `Y(Rasters.Between(min, max))`, defining the Y-coordinate limits. Default is `Y(Rasters.Between(5.34, 39.27))`.
- `start_date`: The start date (inclusive) of the period for which to load data. Should be an instance of `Date`. Default is `Date(2012, 04)`.
- `end_date`: The end date (inclusive) of the period for which to load data. Should be an instance of `Date`. Default is `Date(2023, 01)`.

# Returns
Two data cubes. The first contains the radiance data, and the second contains the coverage data. Each data cube includes data from the start_date to the end_date, sorted in ascending order.
# Examples

Read nighttime lights data from a specific directory and return two raster data cubes representing radiance and coverage. This function also crops the rasters based on the given geometry.

# Arguments
- `geom`: A geometry object, which will be used to crop the rasters. This could be an instance of `Geometry`, `Polygon`, `MultiPolygon`, etc. from a shapefile.
- `start_date`: The start date (inclusive) of the period for which to load data. Should be an instance of `Date`. Default is `Date(2012, 04)`.
- `end_date`: The end date (inclusive) of the period for which to load data. Should be an instance of `Date`. Default is `Date(2023, 01)`.

# Returns
Two `RasterDataCube` instances. The first contains the cropped radiance data, and the second contains the cropped coverage data. Each `RasterDataCube` includes data from the `start_date` to the `end_date`, sorted in ascending order.

# Examples
```julia
using Geometries

end_date = Date(2020, 12)
